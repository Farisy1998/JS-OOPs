// A module in JS is a seperate file which concerns only about a special
// logic or purpose. Through modules we can increase the maintainability
// of out application. And also helps in implementing the pure abstraction
// concept in JS applications. We use different module formats to implement
// the modularity in our application

// Before ES6 (ie, in ES5) we used,
// 1. AMD(Asyncronous Module Definition) - to implement modularity in browser applications.
// 2. CommonJS - to implement modularity in Node.JS applications.
// 3. UMD(Universal Module Definition) - to implement modularity in both
//          browser and Node.JS.

// But in ES6, it has the native module formating.
